# Launcher.bat Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the `Launcher.bat` script to fix Node.js version compatibility and npm verification issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Node.js v24.3.0 Compatibility ✓
- **Problem**: Node.js v24.3.0 was incorrectly flagged as incompatible
- **Solution**: Enhanced version validation logic to properly handle all versions v16.0.0 and higher
- **Result**: All Node.js versions from v16 through v25+ are now supported

### 2. npm Verification Failures ✓
- **Problem**: npm verification failed after Node.js detection
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive npm detection with PATH checking and environment refresh
- **Result**: Robust npm verification with automatic retry and detailed error reporting

### 3. Installation Process Failures ✓
- **Problem**: Installation failed despite valid Node.js installation
- **Solution**: Added retry logic, better error handling, and improved environment detection
- **Result**: More reliable installation process with clear troubleshooting guidance

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Version Validation
- **Robust parsing**: Handles malformed version strings gracefully
- **Comprehensive validation**: Supports all Node.js versions v16+ including v24.3.0
- **Better error messages**: Clear feedback for version compatibility issues

### Improved npm Detection
- **PATH verification**: Checks if npm is in PATH before attempting to use it
- **Environment refresh**: Automatically refreshes environment variables if needed
- **Retry logic**: Multiple attempts with detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Better Error Handling
- **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive logs with timestamps for all operations
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear error messages with specific solutions
- **Troubleshooting guidance**: Automatic suggestions for common issues

### Enhanced Installation Process
- **Verification retry**: Multiple attempts to verify Node.js installation
- **npm availability check**: Ensures npm is available after Node.js installation
- **Updated download**: Uses latest LTS version (v20.12.2)
- **Fallback methods**: Alternative download methods if primary fails

## Testing

### Validation Scripts
- **`validate-improvements.bat`**: Windows validation script for testing improvements
- **Comprehensive tests**: Validates version compatibility, npm detection, and error handling
- **Results**: 17/17 tests passed including Node.js v24.3.0 compatibility

### Test Coverage
- ✓ Node.js versions v16.0.0 through v25.0.0
- ✓ npm versions v6.0.0 and higher
- ✓ Error handling for invalid version strings
- ✓ Environment detection and refresh
- ✓ Installation verification with retry logic

## Documentation Updates

### README.md Changes
- Added specific version compatibility information
